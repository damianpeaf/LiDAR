# LiDAR

## Overview

This project focuses on utilizing LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) technology for archaeological studies, specifically to create detailed 3D models of structures and sites in Guatemala. The research aims to develop an accessible and functional tool for generating precise spatial data using LiDAR sensors, considering economic viability, portability, and environmental sensitivity.

Given the high cost of commercial LiDAR solutions, the focus is on leveraging open-source software and platforms to enable its use with limited resources.
